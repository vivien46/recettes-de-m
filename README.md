# Project Name

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Introduction

A brief description of what your project does, its purpose, and what problem it solves.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have installed the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6.x or higher)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- An account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** : Pages are rendered on the server for better SEO and dynamic content.
- **API Routes** : Custom API routes to handle data fetching and server-side logic.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration** : Fully responsive design powered by Tailwind CSS.
- **PostgreSQL Database Integration** : Connection to a PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage.
- **Deploy on Vercel** : One-click deployment to Vercel with full CI/CD support.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Configuration

### Copy `.env.sample` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

### Sample `.env` file

```env
DATABASE_USER=user
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_NAME=database_db
DATABASE_PASSWORD=userpassword
DATABASE_PORT=5432
```

#### Environment Variables Explanation:

- `DATABASE_USER`: The username to connect to your PostgreSQL database.
- `DATABASE_HOST`: The host where your PostgreSQL database is running (usually `localhost` for local development).
- `DATABASE_NAME`: The name of the database.
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`: The password for the database user.
- `DATABASE_PORT`: The port on which PostgreSQL is running (default is `5432`).

## API Routes

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Testing

(Optional) Add any instructions for running tests or linters.
